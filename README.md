SwiftUI AdaptiveImageGlyph is a sample project that demonstrates how to integrate `UITextView` into a SwiftUI app to enable rich text editing with support for Adaptive Image Glyphs, including Genmojis introduced in iOS 18.

## Features
- **Adaptive Image Glyph Support**: Display and interact with Apple’s Genmojis in a SwiftUI environment.
- **SwiftUI Integration**: Example code for embedding using the component in SwiftUI.
- **Saving to Core Data**: Includes a Core Data implementation for persistent storage.

## Origin

This project is largely based on the implementation from my app **Kyo 2.0**. It demonstrates the same techniques and functionality used in the app for rich text editing and Adaptive Image Glyphs integration. Essentially, it’s a stripped-down version of Kyo 2.0's rich text editing features, made into a quick example.

Check out [Kyo 2.0](https://testflight.apple.com/join/3Vm6nEBy).

## Requirements
- iOS 18+
- Xcode 15+
- SwiftUI

## Usage
- The examples show how to use `UITextView` for handling rich text in SwiftUI.
- Adaptive Image Glyphs (Genmoji) are automatically supported through the `supportsAdaptiveImageGlyph` flag.
